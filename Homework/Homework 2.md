# Homework 2 - Ground Detection

You have a scene with a ground plane and a player that can move.
You can use the Homework 2 Base scene from Ivan's Physics exercise.

The task is to write a script that lets the player jump.
Jumping is allowed only if the player was previously on the ground 
(otherwise he would be able to jump to infinity).

Think of the edge cases when implementing the script.
For example will it still work if the ground plane was sligtly tilted?
