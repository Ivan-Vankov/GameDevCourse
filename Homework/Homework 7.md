# Homework 7 - Doom Coding Practice

The task is to use [this project](https://github.com/Ivan-Vankov/GameDevCourse/tree/gh-pages/Ivan/Coding%20Practice) as a base and add to it the following:

* UI - Doom HUD with armor, health, ammo and character head<br>
    * It should update when taking damage and using ammo<br>
* AI - State Machine AI for the enemy soldier that makes him shoot the player and then back off for a second<br>
* Animation<br>
    * The weapon should be animated when firing
    * The enemy soldier should be animated when firing and backing off
    * The character head in the HUD should be animated when idle, shooting and taking damage<br>
* Shader - Red pulsing vignette around the corners of the screen when on low health<br>

Assets for all the animations and UI are provided in the [base project](https://github.com/Ivan-Vankov/GameDevCourse/tree/gh-pages/Ivan/Coding%20Practice/Assets/Sprites) (all of them from the original Doom game by ID Software).
